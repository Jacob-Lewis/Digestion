How Competition Works

Everybody gets that, at some level, the idea of business is to generate profits, and that businesses are constrained in their ability to do so by the existence of other businesses ([[Competition]].)
The first are the “adversarialists,” who think competition is everything. They’re focused on being the best, and trouncing rivals.
The second camp subscribes to the opposite belief, and denies that competition exists at all.
Porter argues that that’s more optional than you’d think. Human needs are nuanced, and there’s almost always room to find a unique position in the market, rather than fight over one somebody else already occupies. When businesses engage in ruthless head-on competition, it tends to center on pricing, and erodes profits for everyone involved.
Michael Porter defines competition in business as the struggle to attain a profitable, unique position in the market. Instead of “competing to be the best,” you should “compete to be unique.” 
I find it quite useful to think of a free market economy—or partly free market economy—­as a sort of equivalent of an ecosystem. Just as animals flourish in niches, people who specialize in some narrow niche can do very well
a unique strategy is worth nothing without great execution, and execution is usually the hard part. But, if your plan is to energetically pursue the same strategy as everyone else, it won’t lead to riches.
As a manager of an existing business, your job is to fortify your niche in the ecosystem, so that nobody is tempted to take it.
As an entrepreneur creating a new business, your job is to create the next layer of complexity. Look for what is newly possible, or newly revealed to be possible.
