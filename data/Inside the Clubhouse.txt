Inside the Clubhouse

Clubhouse is working because it’s halfway between a podcast and a party, and people love both of those things.
But why live audio? Why show a list of everyone who’s listening? Why allow listeners to become speakers?
First, live audio enables a uniquely efficient form of social learning. When you can see a person responding to new information on the fly, it’s easier to piece together the deeper patterns that govern their thinking.
Second, and more importantly, on Clubhouse you can meet great people.
How do you meet people on Clubhouse? You join a room where you know people, and raise your hand to speak, or are invited to. This simple mechanic makes a huge difference. It’s the core “grind” of Clubhouse. And it solves one of the biggest problems with podcasting
TTYL took a totally different approach, and like Clubhouse is/was focused on spontaneous audio conversations, but only amongst friends. There’s no global view of conversations you can join, and no speaker/listener distinction. This created an extreme liquidity challenge.
But because the conversations are public, it solves the liquidity problem that slowed their growth. Being able to join as a listener isn’t just good for liquidity, it’s also less demanding: you can open the app just to listen, when you’re not ready to speak.
The main strategic goal of Clubhouse is to make conversation liquidity even better.
