If at all possible, I’d run it through W3C — the body that governs web standards. At the first meeting, I’d develop a roadmap for experimental new RSS features like allowing podcasters to create playlists of episodes, enabling RAD for advertisers, and making paid subscription podcasts easier. And then I’d start building. I’d publish my implementations of these standards as open source where I can, to enable others to build faster. I’d make sure my podcast and all podcasts within my sphere of influence used these new standards, and I’d coordinate with hosting companies to make sure they gain broader adoption from podcasters.","create-email":"yacovlewis3@gmail.com","create-time":1606190996375,"uid":"QRK2sfzZn","edit-time":1606190996375,"edit-email":"yacovlewis3@gmail.com"}],"uid":"iQazkqF32","edit-time":1606190996375,"edit-email":"yacovlewis3@gmail.com"}],"uid":"0bv_GSrOX","edit-time":1606190996375,"edit-email":"yacovlewis3@gmail.com"}],"edit-time":1606190994941,"edit-email":"yacovlewis3@gmail.com"}]
